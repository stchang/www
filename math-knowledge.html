I recently attended the <A href="http://www.heidelberg-laureate-forum.org/">
 Heidelberg Laureate Forum</A>, in which some older
researchers--mainly Fields Medalists and Turing Award winners--talked
to and with young researchers.&nbsp; The young researchers ranged from
a few students just entering university to young faculty members, most
being graduate students.&nbsp;  They came from all over the world and were
about evenly divided between mathematicians and computer scientists.&nbsp;
There was a rigorous selection process, and almost all the young
researchers seemed to be very intelligent.
</p>

In my talk I presented a formula that I said was the definition of
"the set of all permutations from 1 to N" [sic].&nbsp;  I had already
explained that &nbsp;[1..N &xrarr; 1..N]&nbsp; is the set of functions
that map the set &nbsp;1..N&nbsp; of integers from 1
through N into itself, and that I was writing &nbsp;f[x]&nbsp; instead
of &nbsp;f(x)&nbsp; to mean function application.&nbsp;  Here's the formula,
about how it appeared on my slide:
</p>

<DL> <DD> <font size=+1> {f &isin; [1..N &xrarr; 1..N] &nbsp;: 
   <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&forall; y
&isin; 1..N &nbsp;:&nbsp; &exist; x &isin; 1..N &nbsp;:&nbsp; f[x]=y} </font> </DL> </font>

<p style="width:600px" width>

 
I then asked the audience to raise their hands if they could
look at this formula and understand it.&nbsp;  About half the audience
raised their hands.&nbsp;  I then asked all the mathematicians to
lower their hands.&nbsp;  Almost no hands remained up.&nbsp;
Hardly any of the computer scientists could understand it.
</p>

<p style="width:600px" width>

Remember, these were specially selected, bright young researchers from around
the world.&nbsp;  
</p>

<p style="width:600px" width>

This may explain why TLA+ is not more widely used, and
why it should be.

lasts about 2.5 minutes; you can go directly to that part by <A href="https://youtu.be/FKFH_-QogN0?t=901">clicking here</a>.
