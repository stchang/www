TLA+ is not hard to learn.&nbsp; <A
href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2699417">Amazon engineers
report</A>  that:  

<blockquote>"Engineers from entry level to principal have been
able to learn TLA+ from scratch and get useful results in two to three
weeks, in some cases in their personal time on weekends and evenings,
without further help or training."</blockquote>

However, programmers and software engineers find TLA+ specs
intimidating at first sight.&nbsp;
<!--
 because it doesn't look like a programs
and it uses very basic math (sets and functions).  They quickly get
used to the language, and writing specs teaches them how simple and
powerful that basic math is.  
 -->
I'm not going to risk scaring you now with a TLA+ spec.&nbsp;  Instead,
I'll present an example in PlusCal.

<p>

PlusCal looks like a simple toy programming language, except that an
expression can be any TLA+ expression&mdash;meaning any mathematical
formula&mdash;making it infinitely more expressive than any programming
language.&nbsp;  The algorithm is translated into a TLA+ specification
that can be checked with the TLA+ tools.&nbsp;  PlusCal is not as
expressive as TLA+, but it is often more convenient to use than raw
TLA+, especially for simple algorithms.&nbsp;

<p>
The example is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peterson%27s_algorithm">
Peterson's mutual exclusion algorithm</a>.&nbsp;  Here is the PlusCal code:

<pre style="font-size:14px">
   --algorithm Peterson {
      variables flag = [i \in {0, 1} |-> FALSE],  turn = 0;
         <font color="green">\* Declares the global variables flag and turn and their initial values;
         \* flag is a 2-element array with initially flag[0] = flag[1] = FALSE.</font>
      fair process (proc \in {0,1}) {
        <font color="green">\* Declares two processes with identifier self equal to 0 and 1.
        \* The keyword fair means that no process can stop forever if it can
        \* always take a step.</font>
        a1: while (TRUE) {
             skip ;  <font color="green">\* the noncritical section</font>
        a2:  flag[self] := TRUE ;
        a3:  turn := 1 - self ;   
        a4:  await (flag[1-self] = FALSE) \/ (turn = self); <font color="green">\* \/ is written || in C.</font>
        cs:  skip ;  <font color="green">\* the critical section</font>
        a5:  flag[self] := FALSE               }     }     }
</pre>


To specify a concurrent algorithm, you must say what the 
atomic operations are.&nbsp;  In PlusCal, the code from one label to the
next is executed atomically.&nbsp;

<p>

The TLC model checker can verify that the algorithm satisfies two
important properties: mutual exclusion, meaning that two processes are
never executing their critical section at the same time; and
starvation freedom, meaning that each process keeps executing its
critical section.&nbsp; The TLA+ translation introduces an array
variable &nbsp;<code>pc</code>&nbsp; whose value indicates where each process is in its
algorithm.&nbsp; In particular,
  &nbsp;<code>pc[i] = "cs"</code>&nbsp;
means that process &nbsp;<code>i</code>&nbsp; is in its critical
section, so mutual exclusion means that
&nbsp;<code>pc[0]</code>&nbsp; and &nbsp;<code>pc[1]</code>&nbsp; are
never both equal to &nbsp;<code>"cs"</code>&nbsp;.&nbsp; 
This condition can be written as
<pre>
   (pc[0] /= "cs") \/ (pc[1] /= "cs")
</pre>
or more compactly as 
&nbsp;<code>{pc[0],pc[1]} /=
{"cs"}</code>&nbsp;.&nbsp; TLC can check that it is always true in any
execution of the algorithm.&nbsp; Starvation freedom here means that
each process executes its critical section infinitely often.&nbsp;
This is expressed in temporal logic by the formula <pre>
  &forall; i &isin; {0,1} : &#9744;&#9826;(pc[i] = "cs") <i><font color="green">typed as</font></i> \A i \in {0,1} : []&lt;&gt;(pc[i] = "cs")
</pre>
TLC can check that this property is satisfied by every execution of the
algorithm.&nbsp;

<p>

In Peterson's algorithm, each read or write of a global variable should
be in a separate atomic action.&nbsp;  This is not true in the PlusCal code
above because statement &nbsp;<code>a4</code>&nbsp; reads both
&nbsp;<code>flag[1-self]</code>&nbsp; and &nbsp;<code>turn</code>&nbsp;.&nbsp;  This can be fixed by
replacing statement &nbsp;<code>a4</code>&nbsp; with 
<pre>
        a4: while (TRUE) {
              a4a: if (flag[1-self] = FALSE) {goto cs};
              a4b: if (turn = self) {goto cs}           } ;
</pre>
TLC can verify that the resulting algorithm also satisfies mutual exclusion
and starvation freedom.&nbsp;
