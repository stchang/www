When people think of representing the execution of a system by a
behavior (a sequence of states), they think of some kind of global
clock that tells the system to change state each time it ticks.&nbsp;  But
that's not a good way to represent real systems.&nbsp;  There is no single
global clock that controls all systems.&nbsp;  Every system would need its
own clock.&nbsp;  It's difficult to speak of relations between
specifications, such as that one implements the other, if the two
systems have different global clocks.&nbsp;  It would be like trying to
relate two interacting physical systems described in terms of two
different physical clocks that ran at different, varying rates.

<p>

A system is a physical device that operates in real time.&nbsp;  Although
all physical devices operate continuously, we can pretend that a
digital system changes state instantaneously at discrete times.&nbsp;  We
can view the behavior that describe the execution as the frames of a
video.&nbsp;  (Readers born in the last millenium can think of it as a
film.)&nbsp;  The requirement for the video to be a valid representation is
that every state the system reaches appears in at least one frame.&nbsp;  A
specification describes the set of all valid videos of correct system
behaviors.&nbsp;  If we speed up the camera's frame rate so that the same
state appears on more frames, it's still a valid video of the same
system, so it should still satisfy the specification.&nbsp;

<p>

For any two system specifications <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, specification
<i>A</i> implements (or refines) specification <i>B</i> means that
every valid video of both systems that satisfies <i>A</i> also
satisfies <i>B</i>.&nbsp;  Note that we can turn any valid video of <i>A</i>
that shows the states of both systems into a valid video of both
<i>A</i> and <i>B</i> by adding extra frames (stuttering steps of
<i>A</i>) if necessary.&nbsp;  

<p> 

Why should a video of one system show the state of another?&nbsp;  Why
should a video of an hour/minute clock show the seconds display?&nbsp;  To
answer this, we need to consider what a state is.&nbsp;  When we say that a
system execution is represented by a behavior, it's natural
to assume that each of those states is an assignment of values to the
variables that describe the system, and perhaps also to variables that
describe how the system's environment interacts with it.&nbsp;  But a TLA+
specification is a mathematical formula.&nbsp;  Moreover, a semantics for
any specification language translates any spec in that language to 
a mathematical formula.&nbsp;  So let's look at what 
mathematical formulas mean.&nbsp;

<p>

The formula &thinsp;x + y = 1&thinsp; is an assertion about the values
of the variables &thinsp;x&thinsp; and &thinsp;y&thinsp;.&nbsp;  But it's
not an assertion about a universe containing only the variables
&thinsp;x&thinsp; and &thinsp;y&thinsp;.&nbsp;  You write another formula
&thinsp;x - y = z&thinsp; without having to say, hey I've now added
the variable &thinsp;z&thinsp; to my universe of discourse.&nbsp;  The
formula &thinsp;x + y = 1&thinsp; is implicitly an assertion about a
universe described by the values of all possible variables.&nbsp;  It just
makes an assertion about the variables &thinsp;x&thinsp; and
&thinsp;y&thinsp;.&nbsp;  It doesn't imply that there are no other variables.

<p>

It's now easy to see that a state should be an assignment of values to
all possible variables.&nbsp;  In TLA+, the names of all possible variables
are all the identifiers allowed by the language.&nbsp;  (If a module defines
<i>Init</i> to equal some expression, then the universe still contains
a variable named <i>Init</i>; we just can't use it in that module.)&nbsp;
So our videos show the values of the (theoretically) infinite number of
possible variables.&nbsp;  The spec
<pre>
   Spec == (v=0)  /\  [][v' = v+1]_v  
</pre>
(where &thinsp;v&thinsp; is declared to be a variable) allows 
infinitely many behaviors, because it allows behaviors
in which every variable other than &thinsp;v&thinsp; can assume
any value in any of its states.

<p> 

I hope it is now even more obvious why we shouldn't be able to
write a spec that doesn't allow stuttering steps.&nbsp;  A spec of an
hour/minute clock asserting that the minute display changes with every
step would say that the universe can contain no clock that displays
seconds.&nbsp;  That would be a really weird spec.  

<p>

This may sound terribly complicated, saying that the simple
specification&thinsp; Spec&thinsp; above should allow so many
behaviors.&nbsp;  It shouldn't.&nbsp;  When you were a child, it didn't seem
complicated that the formula &thinsp;x + y = 1&thinsp; allowed
&thinsp;z&thinsp;, &thinsp;w&thinsp;, &thinsp;v&thinsp;,
&thinsp;u&thinsp; etc.&nbsp;  to have any values.&nbsp;  It would have been
complicated if the formula implied that those other variables didn't
exist.&nbsp;
