The TLA Toolbox is an IDE (integrated development environment)
for the TLA+ tools.&nbsp; You can use it to:

<UL>
<LI class=smallLI>Create and edit your specs, with the locations of parsing errors
marked in the modules.</LI>
<p>
<LI class=smallLI>Run the PlusCal translator, with the locations of translation
errors marked in the PlusCal code.<BR></LI>
<p>
<LI class=smallLI>View the pretty-printed versions of your modules.</LI>
<p>
<LI class=smallLI>Run the TLC model checker.&nbsp; 


The Toolbox allows you to explorer an error trace produced by
TLC&mdash;for example, by evaluating arbitrary formulas at each step
in the trace.


<p>
<LI class=smallLI> Run the 
<a href="http://tla.msr-inria.inria.fr/tlaps">TLA+ proof system.</a>

</UL>
The Toolbox was written by Simon Zambrovski and improved by Markus Kuppe
and Daniel Ricketts.

<DIV id="install" class="hidden-div"> 
Here are the instructions for the different operating systems.

<h4>Windows</h4>

Download the zip file into a convenient folder.&nbsp; 
Extract the contents of the file by right-clicking on it
in the File Explorer and selecting <i>Extract All</i>.&nbsp;

You can choose what folder to put the extracted files in; the
default is a subfolder of the folder containing the zip file.&nbsp;

Select the <i>Show extracted files when complete</i> option and
click on <i>Extract</i>.&nbsp;  The extracted files will be
in a subfolder named <i>toolbox</i>&nbsp;  

Open that subfolder.&nbsp;  You can run the Toolbox by double-clicking on
the file called <code>toolbox</code> or <code>toolbox.exe</code>.&nbsp;  

But before doing that, you probably want to make it easier to
run the Toolbox later by doing one of the following:
<ul>
<li style="margin-top:-10px"> 
  Create a shortcut by right-clicking on the file and selecting
    <i>Create shortcut</i>, then
  move the shortcut to the desktop or some other convenient 
    location.&nbsp;
  You can run the Toolbox by double-clicking on the shortcut.
<li style="margin-top:5px"> Right-click on the file and select <i>Pin to Start</i> or
    <i>Pin to taskbar</i>.&nbsp; You can then run the Toolbox from the
    Start Menu or the taskbar.
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-top:-10px">Mac OS</h4>

Download the file and, if necessary, unzip it by double-clicking on
it.&nbsp; (Depending on how your browser and system are set up, the
downloaded file may already be unzipped.)&nbsp; This results in an
application bundle called <i>TLA+ Toolbox.app</i>, which you can move
to the Applications folder.&nbsp; The Toolbox can be started by
double-clicking that application.&nbsp; When you open the application
for the first time, you will likely need to control-click
(right-click) on the application, choose <i>Open</i> from the
drop-down menu, and confirm that you want to open the application in
the subsequent dialog box.&nbsp; This is due to Apple's security
settings since the Toolbox is not distributed through the App Store.

<p>

For Homebrew users, a Toolbox Cask is available with the name
<code>tla-plus-toolbox</code>.

<h4>Linux</h4>

<!--
   Here are instructions for Debian, Ubunto, Fedora, RHEL, and CentOS:
   <ul>
   <li> Open the download site in a browser
   
   <li> For Debian and Ubunto, click on the link to the <code>.deb</code>
        file; for Fedora, RHEL, and CentOS, click
        on the link to the <code>.rmp</code> file.
   
   <li> The browser will open the software installer, 
   prompting to install the Toolbox.
   
   <li> Click on the <i>install</i> button.
   </ul>
   The Toolbox can then be opened with the system menu.  
   
   <p>
   For other flavors of Linux, download the proper zip file and
   extract its contents to a convenient directory.&nbsp;  Open the
   <code>toolbox</code> subdirectory.&nbsp;  You can then run the Toolbox
   by executing the <code>toolbox</code> file in that subdirectory.

To run the TLA+ pretty-printer (with the Toolbox's <i>Produce PDF
Version</i> command), the <code>pdflatex</code> program must be
installed on your computer.&nbsp;  That program is distributed as
part of a LaTeX installation, and it will already be installed if
you use TeX or LaTeX.&nbsp;  It may also be installed if  
you're running Linux.&nbsp;  Run the command
 <pre>    pdflatex -help</pre>
in a command shell / terminal window to see if it's already
installed.&nbsp; If it isn't, you should install LaTeX on your
computer.&nbsp;

<A href="https://www.latex-project.org/">The LaTeX Project</a>
has links to various sources of LaTeX.&nbsp; 

Here are ones that we recommend for different operating systems.&nbsp;

Whatever method you use, you should check with a command shell
that it is installed.&nbsp;  (Open a new command shell after you
install LaTeX.)

<h4>Windows</h4>

<a href="https://miktex.org/">MikTeX</a> comes with detailed
<a href="https://miktex.org/howto/install-miktex">installation
instructions</a>.

<h4>Mac OS</h4>

The <a href="http://www.tug.org/mactex/">MacTeX</a> web page points to
simple instructions for downloading the file
<code>MacTeX.pkg</code>.&nbsp; It claims that running the file
provides straightforward instructions for installing LaTeX.&nbsp; 
You can ignore instructions on how to write a LaTeX document.

<p>

If you already use a manager for open-source software packages such as
<a href="https://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a> or <a
href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>, you can use it to install
LaTeX.&nbsp; Please refer to the instructions of your package manager
for details.

<h4>Linux</h4>

The provider of your Linux software should also be able to provide you
with LaTeX for it.

When you run the Toolbox, the instructions that appear on the
welcome screen tell you what to do next: namely, read the indicated

fixed.&nbsp; The current bug repository, where you can look for known

Implementing the Toolbox has involved a lot of work by few people.
They were able to build a
sophisticated tool in a short time by using <a

compromises, and there are some annoying (but not serious)
inconveniences in the Toolbox because they either didn't have the time
or the Eclipse expertise to fix them.&nbsp; So, please try to be
helpful instead of angry if something doesn't work right.&nbsp; Report
the problem if it's not already in the bug list, and help us fix it if you
can.&nbsp; Thanks.
