  <DD> This is the basic TLA reference, introducing the logic and
       proof rules.<P>
      <EM>Abstract</EM>: 
      The temporal logic of actions (TLA) is a logic for specifying and
      reasoning about concurrent systems.  Systems and their properties are
      represented in the same logic, so the assertion that a system meets its
      specification and the assertion that one system implements another are
      both expressed by logical implication.  TLA is very simple; its syntax
      and complete formal semantics are summarized in about a
      page.  Yet, TLA is not just a logician's toy; it is extremely powerful,
      both in principle and in practice.  This report introduces TLA and
      describes how it is used to specify and verify concurrent algorithms.
      The use of TLA to specify and reason about open systems will be
      described elsewhere. (51 pages) <BR>

  reactive
  systems that combines the temporal logic TLA with full first-order
  logic and ZF set theory.  TLC is a new model checker for debugging a
  TLA+ specification by checking invariance properties of a
  finite-state model of the specification.  It accepts a subclass of
  TLA+ specifications that should include most descriptions of real
  system designs.  It has been used by engineers to find errors in the
  cache coherence protocol for a new Compaq multiprocessor.  We
  describe TLA+ specifications and their TLC models, how TLC works,
  and our experience using it.  In Charme '99.

      <I>22 December 1993</I>
    <DD> <EM>Abstract</EM>: 
      Traditional methods for specifying and reasoning about concurrent
      systems work for real-time systems.  Using TLA (the temporal logic of
      actions), we illustrate how they work with the examples of a queue and
      of a mutual-exclusion protocol.  In general, two problems must be
      addressed: avoiding the real-time programming version of Zeno's
      paradox, and coping with circularities when composing real-time
      assumption/guarantee specifications.  Their solutions rest on

    <DD> This paper describes how to write and reason about open system 
      specifications--also known as
      rely/guarantee specifications.  It is rather hard going,
      but Section 2 gives a simple introduction to the issues. <P>
     <EM>Abstract</EM>: 
      We show how to specify components of concurrent systems.  The
      specification of a system is the conjunction of its components'
      specifications.  Properties of the system are proved by reasoning
      about its components.  We consider both the decomposition of a given
      system into parts, and the composition of given parts to form a
      system.<BR>

         <EM>Abstract</EM>: 
         Predicate-action diagrams, which are similar to conventional
      state-transition diagrams, are defined as representations of formulas
      in the temporal logic of actions (TLA).  These diagrams can be used to
      express formal properties of specifications and to illustrate
      correctness proofs. (8 large pages) <BR>

    <DD>Here is the famous gas burner of Ravn, Rischel, and Hansen

        <EM>Abstract</EM>: 
         \TLA+ is a general purpose, formal specification language based on the
      Temporal Logic of Actions, with no built-in primitives for specifying
      real-time properties.  Here, we use \TLA+ to define operators for
      specifying the temporal behavior of physical components obeying
      integral equations of evolution.  These operators, together with
      previously defined operators for describing timing constraints, are
      used to specify a toy gas burner introduced by Ravn, Rischel, and
      Hansen.  The burner is specified at three levels of abstraction, each
      of the two lower-level specifications implementing the next
      higher-level one.  Correctness proofs are sketched. <BR>

      <I>14 April 1993</I>
   <DD> This is the first application of a general method, described in 
       <A HREF = "#ConjoiningSpecs">"Conjoining Specifications"</A>, for
       splitting off finite-state parts of a non-finite-state verification
       problem for verification by a model checker.<P>
      <EM>Abstract</EM>: 
       Verifying a 64-bit multiplier has a computational complexity that puts
      it beyond the grasp of current finite-state algorithms, including
      those based upon homomorphic reduction, the induction principle, and
      bdd fixed-point algorithms.  Theorem proving, while not bound by the
      same computational constraints, may not be feasible for routinely
      coping with the complex, low-level details of a real multiplier.  We
      show how to verify such a multiplier by applying COSPAN, a
      model-checking algorithm, to verify local properties of the complex
      low-level circuit, and using TLP, a theorem prover based on the
      Temporal Logic of Actions, to prove that these properties imply the
      correctness of the multiplier.  Both verification steps are automated,
      and we plan to mechanize the translation between the languages of TLP
      and COSPAN. <BR>

     <B>Mechanical Verification of Concurrent Systems with TLA</B></A> <BR>

   <DD> This describes a now obsolete version of TLP, the mechanical
       verification system based primarily on LP. <P>
      <EM>Abstract</EM>: 
      We describe an initial version of a system for mechanically checking
      the correctness proof of a concurrent system.  Input to the system
      consists of the correctness properties, expressed in TLA (the temporal
      logic of actions), and their proofs, written in a humanly readable,
      hierarchically structured form.  The system uses a mechanical verifier
      to check each step of the proof, translating the step's assertion into
      a theorem in the verifier's logic and its proof into instructions for
      the verifier.  Checking is now done by LP (the Larch Prover),
      using two different translations--one for action reasoning and one
      for temporal reasoning.  The use of additional mechanical verifiers is
      planned.  Our immediate goal is a practical system for mechanically
      checking proofs of behavioral properties of a concurrent system; we
      assume ordinary properties of the data structures used by the system. <BR>
