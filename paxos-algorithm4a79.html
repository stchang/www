In July 2019 I gave a pair of 1-1/2 hour lectures at a summer
school on distributed computing in Saint Petersburg, Russia.&nbsp;
The lectures covered three topics:
<ul>
<li> The Paxos consensus algorithm.</li>
 
<li> TLA+ </li>

<li> How to win a Turing award.</li> 

</ul> 

If you are interested in any of those topics, you might want to watch
the videos of the lectures.&nbsp; In them, I present a rigorous
development of the Paxos consensus algorithm that formalizes the
thinking I believe led me to discover it.&nbsp; I explain the
algorithm with three specifications: a trivial one stating what the
algorithm is supposed to accomplish, a high-level algorithm in which
each process directly views the state of every other process, and the
actual algorithm in which processes communicate by sending messages.

<p>

The lectures assume no prior knowledge of the Paxos consensus
algorithm or of TLA+, the language in which the specifications are
written.&nbsp;

In fact, the lectures constitute a crash course on TLA+.&nbsp;

If you're interested just in the algorithm, you will probably find the
specs annoying and will try to read only the plentiful comments,
ignoring the TLA+.&nbsp;

To understand the algorithm, you will have to stop the
video at certain points and read the specs&mdash;either the ASCII
sources in the <code>.tla</code> files or the pretty-printed versions
in the <code>.pdf</code> files.&nbsp; I hope that you will eventually
appreciate the elegance and precision of the TLA+
specs.

<p>

Here are links to the two videos and to accompanying material,
which is contained in a <code>zip</code> file that you should download:
<pre>
    <a href="https://youtu.be/tw3gsBms-f8">Lecture 1</a>       <a href="https://youtu.be/8-Bc5Lqgx_c">Lecture 2</a>       <a href="st-pete-lecture-exercises.zip">Accompanying Material</a> 
</pre> 

The accompanying material consists of the specs described in the
lectures and follow-up exercises you can do after watching the videos.
The file <code>README.txt</code> contains instructions for the
exercises.
