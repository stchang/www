This is the home page of the TLA+ web site.&nbsp;
TLA+ is a high-level language for modeling programs and
systems--especially concurrent and distributed ones.&nbsp;  It's based on
the idea that the best way to describe things precisely is with simple
mathematics.&nbsp;  TLA+ and its tools are useful for eliminating
fundamental design errors, which are hard to find and expensive to correct
in code.&nbsp;  The following are the top-level pages of the web site.

<!-- 
<p>

Since the work of Floyd and Hoare in the late 1960s, it has been
generally agreed that the behavior of a sequential programs is best
thought of as a sequence of states, and we should think of a step of a
program as a state-changing event.&nbsp;  I have found this to be true of
concurrent and distributed systems as well.&nbsp;  States are important
because what a system does in the future is controlled by its current
state, not by what happened in the past.

<p>



<hr>


Some methods, including TLA+, have a way of hiding part of the state.
They can describe a system as behaving <em>as if</em> that hidden
state exists, but it needn't actually exist.&nbsp;  There is little
practical benefit in doing this.&nbsp;  Understanding the system requires
understanding the complete state, including its hidden part.&nbsp;  In
practice, it suffices to simply say in a comment that a certain part
of the state need not actually be implemented.
-->


  <!-- 
   Some other methods model a behavior as a sequence of actions.&nbsp;
   The ones that are comparable to TLA+ in terms of their utility employ
   a sequence of states to control the order in which actions can occur,
   the current state determining which actions are possible and the
   action determining the next state.&nbsp; Adding named actions to the
   state changes would add nothing to the usefulness of TLA+.  <p>
  -->

 <!--
   Rarely can we say that one model is better than
   another.&nbsp; We can at most say that one is more useful than another
   for a certain purpose.&nbsp;
 -->

 <!--
   I've found that for most engineering uses, the behavior of a system
   can be modeled as a sequence of events.&nbsp;  If two events represent
   concurrent operations in different processes, the model will allow
   behaviors in which the events occur in either order.&nbsp;
