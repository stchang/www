This page assumes you are familiar enough with TLA+ to be able to
understand a simple TLA+ spec (not just a PlusCal spec).&nbsp;

It contains links to documents explaining topics that go beyond what
most engineers need to know about TLA+.&nbsp;

These topics may be useful to engineers who want to push the boundary
of what they can do with TLA+, and they will be of interest to
those who want a deeper understanding of the principles underlying
TLA+.&nbsp;

It seems obvious to me that in any sensible definition of
<i>implementation</i>, a clock that displays hours, minutes, and
seconds should implement the specification of a clock that displays
hours and minutes.&nbsp;  

I realized in 1983 that the simplest way to ensure that this is true
is to require that all specifications allow <q>stuttering
steps</q>&mdash;steps in which the state of the system does not
change.&nbsp;  Steps of an hour/minute/second clock in which only the
seconds change implement stuttering steps of the hour/minute clock's
specification.&nbsp;  In the decades since then, I have continued to explain
this to people.&nbsp;  To my knowledge, no state-based specification
formalism other than TLA has adopted the idea.&nbsp;

I suspect that even many TLA+ users think it's weird to require that
specifications allow stuttering steps.&nbsp; Here is a link to a short
note explaining why not requiring it is weird:
   <A href =
   "stuttering1505.html?back-link=advanced.html#stuttering?unhideBut@EQhide-stuttering@AMPunhideDiv@EQstuttering"
  > [a link]</A>.&nbsp;
I don't understand why many people write such weird specs.

The terms <i>safety</i>, <i>liveness</i>, and

documentation&mdash;including in the

   TLA+ Video Course</A>.&nbsp;  They are defined precisely 
<A href="safety-liveness.pdf">in this note</A>, which also describes
their significance.&nbsp;  Although it requires little knowledge of TLA+, 
you might find the note to be tough going if you're not used to
reading mathematics.&nbsp;  But it's worth the effort if you want a more
complete understanding of TLA+.

I have been writing correctness proofs of concurrent algorithms for
about 45 years.&nbsp;

I developed what I find to be a natural way of writing these proofs.&nbsp;

However, writing rigorous proofs has remained a black art that few
people have mastered.&nbsp;

Learning to write these proofs starts with learning to write proofs
of safety properties.&nbsp;

I believe that TLA+ and its tools can help you learn to write
these proofs.&nbsp;  

The document <a href="proving-safety.pdf">Proving Safety Properties</a>
shows you how.&nbsp;  

It explains the art of writing rigorous proofs, but not completely
formal machine-checked proofs.&nbsp;

Writing machine-checked proofs requires a lot of additional effort, as
well as practice using the TLAPS proof system.

I started thinking about writing specifications around 1980.&nbsp; I
quickly realized that it was important to understand what it meant for
a program to satisfy a spec.&nbsp; I knew that, in principle, a spec
and an executable program are both specifications of a physical
system, written at two different levels of abstractions.&nbsp; So, I
needed to understand what it meant for one specification to implement
or refine another.&nbsp; This ultimately led me to TLA, the temporal
logic underlying the TLA+ language, and to using the temporal
existential quantification operator (written <code>\EE</code> in TLA+)
to write specifications.&nbsp; This operator served to distinguish
variables that represent externally observable parts of the system
from ones that represent unobservable parts that need not appear in an
implementation.&nbsp; Temporal existential quantification hid those
<q>unobservable</q> variabled.

<p>

With the development of the TLA+ tools and seeing how TLA+ is used in
practice, I came to realize that engineers and computer scientists
didn't need the <code>\EE</code> operator.&nbsp; So, I generally don't
talk about it; and I explain refinement without it.&nbsp; For example,
<code>\EE</code> is not mentioned in the

 <a href="http://lamport.azurewebsites.net/video/videos.html">TLA+ Video 
  Course</a>.&nbsp;



<p>

While engineers don't need to use variable hiding and the
<code>\EE</code> operator, knowing why I used them to write specs
provides a deeper understanding of refinement and  
auxiliary variables.&nbsp; So, I have explained this background in the note

 <A href="hiding-and-refinement.pdf">Hiding, Refinement, and
   Auxiliary Variables</A>.&nbsp; 

You should read it before attempting to read the complete guide to
auxiliary variables in the paper
 <a href="http://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/pubs.html#auxiliary">Auxiliary
 Variables in TLA+</a>.&nbsp;
