This section was written by Brannon Batson, who was then an Intel
engineer.&nbsp; It was preceded by a section describing the use of
TLA+ and TLC at Compaq.&nbsp; Batson and some other Compaq engineers
moved from Compaq to Intel.

<p>

<h2>4.2 &nbsp; Intel </h2>

We now describe the use of TLA+ and TLC by B[rannon] B[atson] and his
colleagues at Intel.&nbsp;  

The actual specifications are proprietary and
have not been viewed by anyone outside Intel. 

<p>

<h3>4.2.1 &nbsp; Overview of the Problem</h3>

Designing a complex system starts with a problem statement and an
appropriate set of boundary conditions.&nbsp;  A component of a computer
system is initially represented abstractly as a black box, with
assertions about its functionality and with some guidelines on
performance, cost, and complexity.&nbsp;  The engineering process involves
iteratively refining this abstract model into lower-level models.&nbsp;
Each lower-level model is a representation of the design at a certain
level of abstraction, and it has a specific purpose.&nbsp;  Some models are
meant to evaluate tradeoffs between scope, performance, cost, and
complexity.&nbsp;  Others carry the design down to the low level of detail
needed to manufacture the component.

<p>

The engineering process therefore creates multiple representations of
a design.&nbsp;  Validation entails checking these multiple representations
against one another.&nbsp;  Designers of digital systems have good tools and
methods for validating mid-level functional models, written in a
hardware description language (HDL)<!-- like VHDL or RTL -->, against
lower-level models such as circuit net-lists.&nbsp;  However, they have not
had as much success checking the higher-level functional
representations of the design against one another, and against the
initial problem statement and functional assertions.&nbsp;

<p>

For some components, there is an intuitive correlation between the
high-level notions of correctness and the HDL model; such components
tend not to be difficult to validate.&nbsp;  Other components, like
multiprocessor cache-coherence protocols, are sufficiently complex
that checking the HDL model against the problem statement is quite
challenging.&nbsp;  We need formal techniques from the world of mathematics
to perform this high-level validation.

<p>

Although formal methods are based on mathematics, engineers view them
differently from the way mathematicians do.&nbsp;  To engineers, formal
verification is simply another imperfect validation tool (albeit a
powerful one).&nbsp;  A TLA+ specification is only an abstraction of the
actual system, and model checking can usually validate the
specification only for a highly restricted set of system parameters.&nbsp;
Validating the specification therefore cannot guarantee that there are
no errors in the system.&nbsp;  For engineers, formal verification is a way
of finding bugs, not of proving correctness.

<p>

The main benefit of applying TLA+ to engineering problems comes from
the efficiency of the TLC model checker in reaching high levels of
coverage and finding bugs.&nbsp;  A secondary benefit 
we have encountered is
the ability of TLA+ and TLC to provide good metrics for the
complexity of a design.&nbsp;  Complexity is a major consideration in
evaluating design tradeoffs.&nbsp;  However, unlike performance or cost,
engineers have not historically had a good way to quantify algorithmic
complexity before attempting to validate a design.&nbsp;  TLA+ encourages
designers to specify the design abstractly, suppressing lower-level
details, so the length of the specification provides a measure of a
design's complexity.&nbsp;  TLC reports the size of the reachable state
space, providing another measure of complexity.&nbsp;  Experience and
intuition will always have a place in evaluating complexity, but TLA+
and TLC provide robust and impartial input to the evaluation.&nbsp;  Having
this input early in the design process is of considerable value.

<p>

<h3>4.2.2 &nbsp; Designing with TLA+</h3>

The core group at Intel started using TLA+ at Compaq while working on
the Alpha EV7 and EV8 multiprocessor projects described above.&nbsp;  From
that experience, the Alpha 
engineers learned that multiprocessor cache-coherence protocols are an
ideal candidate for formal methods because most of the protocol bugs
can be found at a high level of abstraction.&nbsp; They also learned
that the true value of TLA+ and TLC would be realized when (a)&nbsp;they
were applied early enough in the design to provide implementation
feedback, and (b)&nbsp;the implementation was based directly on the
specification that had been verified.&nbsp; On the EV8 project, the
TLA+ specification was completed before the design was stable, and it
provided important feedback to the designers.

<p>

When the engineers from the Alpha group joined Intel, they began
applying their experience in writing TLA+ specifications when
collaborating with other Intel engineers on cache-coherence protocols
for future Intel products.&nbsp;  Intel engineers are now using TLA+ as an
integral part of the design process for the protocols that are under
study.

<p>

<h4 style="margin-bottom:5px">Whiteboard Phase</h4>

Designing one cache-coherence protocol from scratch provided the
engineers with the opportunity to evaluate TLA+ as a prototyping
platform for complex algorithms.&nbsp;  Work on this protocol started by
exploring the design space on a whiteboard for about two
months.&nbsp;  In this phase, basic message sequencing was determined, as
were some coarse notions of what state had to be recorded at the
protocol endpoints.&nbsp;  A basic direction was set, based on the
guidelines for functionality, performance, and cost.

<p>

Because of their background, engineers tend to visualize an algorithm
in terms of a particular implementation.&nbsp;  They are better at
gauging implementation complexity than at measuring algorithmic
complexity.&nbsp;  One benefit of having engineers write formal
specifications is that it helps them learn how to think about a
protocol abstractly, independent of implementation details.&nbsp;  We found
that, even in the whiteboard phase of the protocol design, the Intel
engineers were able to make some judgments on complexity by asking
themselves, <q>How would I code this in TLA+?</q>.

<p>

The whiteboard phase produced a general understanding of the protocol
philosophy, an understanding of the constraints placed on the
communication medium, the basic message flows, and coarse ideas on what 
state needed to be maintained.&nbsp;  The next step was to introduce the
rigor of a formal specification.

<p>

<h4 style="margin-bottom:5px">TLA+ Scratchpad Phase</h4>

The TLA+ scratchpad phase of the project involved formally describing
the abstract system, with appropriate state variables representing
high-level components.&nbsp;  This phase took about two months, starting
with the initial design of the protocol.&nbsp;  The difficulty lay not in
the use of TLA+&thinsp;&mdash; engineers frequently learn new programming
languages&mdash;but rather in (a)&nbsp;determining the layer of abstraction and
(b)&nbsp;exploring the protocol's corner cases.&nbsp;  Task (a) is where TLA+
forces engineers to think about the protocol abstractly, which they
often find unnatural.&nbsp;  Their ability to think abstractly improves with
experience writing TLA+ specifications.&nbsp;  Task (b) is inevitable when
documenting a protocol formally, as it forces the designers to explore
the corner cases.&nbsp;  During the scratchpad phase, the designers had to
return to the whiteboard a few times when they encountered new race
cases while writing the specification.

<p>


The actions that formed the major blocks of the specification were
chosen early; very few changes were made later.&nbsp;  The Intel engineers
adopted a methodology used in the earlier Alpha specifications, in
which the decomposition of high-level named actions is based on
classifying the protocol messages that they process.&nbsp;  This methodology
has led to fairly readable specifications, since it means that each
action changes only a few local state variables.&nbsp;  It encouraged the
protocol specifications to be designed in a modular way, which also
enabled the inter-module interfaces in the specification to be similar
to their low-level counterparts in the implementation.

<p>

<h4 style="margin-bottom:5px">Running TLC</h4>

The initial week or so of running TLC was spent finding and fixing
typographical errors and type mismatch problems.&nbsp;  This time could
probably have been shortened by doing more syntax checking when
writing the specification, which is what one often does when
programming.

<p>

The next four weeks saw a continuous process of running TLC, finding
bugs, fixing them, and re-running TLC.&nbsp;  During this phase of the
project, many assumptions and assertions about the protocol were
brought into question.&nbsp;  This had the effect of educating the engineers
about the protocol they had designed.&nbsp;  We have found that TLC can be a
useful learning tool if we use in-line assertions and global
invariants to check everything we think is true.&nbsp;  The Intel engineers
were able to develop an intuitive understanding of the correctness of
the protocol by developing meaningful global invariants and having TLC
check them.&nbsp;  If an assertion or invariant fails, TLC generates a
counterexample that is useful for visualizing a difficult race case.&nbsp;
These counterexamples are such a powerful teaching aid that the Intel
engineers have developed tools to translate the TLC output into nicely
formatted protocol flow diagrams that are easier to read.

<p>

Another useful feature of the TLC model checker is its coverage
checking.&nbsp;  TLC can print the number of times each action was
<q>executed</q>.&nbsp;  This provides a simple way to identify holes in
coverage.&nbsp;  Much of the effort expended by the engineers in debugging
the specification was spent eliminating each of these holes, or
convincing themselves that it represented an action that could never
happen.&nbsp;

<p>

The performance of the model checker was sufficient to debug a large
protocol specification.&nbsp;  The engineers determined a base configuration
that would <q>execute</q> all the actions and that displayed all
interesting known cases.&nbsp;  This configuration could be run on a
four-processor machine in about a day, enabling fast turn-around on
bug fixes.&nbsp;  Larger configurations were periodically run as sanity
checks on the smaller ones.&nbsp;  The engineers would also run TLC in
simulation mode, which randomly and non-exhaustively explores the
state space, allowing them to check much larger configurations.&nbsp;  Such
random simulations are similar to the ones engineers typically perform
on lower-level models, but it has the advantage of being several
orders of magnitude faster because it is based on the abstract TLA+
model, and it provides a robust metric for coverage.

<p>


<h3>4.2.3 &nbsp; Optimizing with TLC</h3>

Once the initial protocol specification was successfully checked by
TLC, the Intel engineers were able to use it as a test bed for
exploring optimizations.&nbsp;  TLA+ is an ideal language to explore
changes because its expressiveness usually allows the new version to
be written quickly.&nbsp;  Model checking the modified specification with
TLC not only checks functional correctness, but it also measures any
increase in the state space.&nbsp;  Such an increase implies additional
algorithmic complexity.&nbsp;  The engineers spent several months exploring
additions to the protocol, testing them with TLC.&nbsp;  As a general
rule, they would consider adopting only those optimizations that did
not appreciably expand the state space.&nbsp;  The insight that TLA+ and
TLC gave into the complexity of modifications to the protocol was
invaluable in iterating towards an optimal solution that adequately
weighed algorithmic complexity along with factors like cost and
performance.

<p>

A significant optimization was later made to the protocol.&nbsp;  This
optimization followed the normal design cycle described above, though
on a compressed schedule.&nbsp;  With the original design yielding a good
starting point, the entire cycle (whiteboard phase, TLA+ coding, and
verification with TLC) was done within six weeks.&nbsp;  This modification
was accomplished by a recent college graduate with an undergraduate
degree in engineering.&nbsp;  He was able to learn TLA+ well enough within
a matter of weeks to do this work.

<p>


<h3>4.2.4 &nbsp; Feedback on TLA+ syntax</h3>

The feedback we have received from engineers about the TLA+ language
has been mostly positive.&nbsp;  Engineers are usually able to pick up and
understand a specification within a couple of days.&nbsp;  One mistake we
made was to present TLA+ to hardware designers as similar to a
programming language.&nbsp;  This led to some frustration.&nbsp;  A better
approach seems to be to describe TLA+ as being like a hardware
description language.&nbsp;  Engineers who design digital systems are well
acquainted with methods for specifying finite-state machines, with the
associated restrictions of allowing a primed variable to be assigned a
value only once within a conjunction, not allowing a primed variable
to appear in a conjunction before the assignment of its value, etc.&nbsp;
To an engineer, TLA+ looks like a language for specifying
finite-state machines.

<p>

While writing the protocol specification at Intel, BB was impressed by
the ease of specifying complex data structures in TLA+ as sets and
tuples.&nbsp;  The part of the specification that described and manipulated
data structures was a small part of the complete protocol
specification.&nbsp;  This compact specification of <q>bookkeeping tasks</q>,
along with the overall expressiveness of TLA+, won over the engineers
who were accustomed to using more clumsy functional languages for specifying
complex algorithms.

<p>

For the algorithmic specification, TLA+ naturally encourages nested
disjunctions of conjunctions (known to engineers as sums of products of
expressions).&nbsp;  This method for specifying Boolean formulas has both
advantages and disadvantages.&nbsp;  One advantage is that it allows
expressive comment blocks and assertions to be inserted in-line with a
nested conjunct.&nbsp;  A disadvantage is that this tends to lead to large
specifications.&nbsp;  The engineers are experimenting with the use of TLA+
operators to encode large blocks of regular Boolean disjunctions as
truth tables, which engineers find more natural to work with.
