This is a work in progress: a 
  <A HREF ="../tla.html">TLA</A> 
specification of the kernel threads procedures from the Windows Win32
Application Programming Interface (API).  If you want to be informed
when there are significant changes to this specification, send e-mail
to me at
  <A HREF = "mailto:lamport@pa.dec.com">lamport@pa.dec.com</A>.

<P> This is a complete draft, but it still has lots of minor errors,
and possibly some major ones.  There are a number of small details
missing from the specification, mostly concerning error conditions.
Those details are apparently known only within Microsoft.  I hope to
talk to engineers there to learn these details and correct any
inaccuracies in the specification.


<P> The current specification provides a fairly simple model of the
API, in which kernel calls and returns are atomic actions.  The
specification thus does not describe the details of how kernel calls
are made.  This seems to me to be the appropriate interface for
application programmers (and for the implementers), who already
understand how procedure calls are coded.  I intend eventually to
provide a lower-level specification that does model some of the
details of kernel calls.  I will do this by using an interface
refinement that relates the higher-level and lower-level models of
procedure calls, and is independent of the particular kernel calls
being specified.


<P> The specification is written in an "object oriented" style, which
is discussed in the introduction.

<P> The specification is:
 <DL> <DD>
       <A HREF = "spec.ps.z">Postscript</A> -
       <A HREF = "spec.dvi.z">DVI</A>       -
       <A HREF = "spec.tex.z">LaTeX</A> <P>
</DL>
To run the document through LaTeX (version 2e required), you will need
the following files:
 <DL> <DD>
       <A HREF = "tla.sty.z">tla.sty</A> -
       <A HREF = "tlaspec92.sty.z">tlaspec92.sty</A> 
 </DL>
