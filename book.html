<FONT size=+1> This book won an award for its cover design
at the New England Book Show.  A production editor at Addison-Wesley wrote: 
<BLOCKQUOTE style="margin-top:8px">
   For those of you who are unfamiliar with the Book Show, I think of it
   as the Emmys of book production.  Many different publishers
   participate, competition is steep, and there [are] often hundreds of
   nominations for the judges to review.

<H4>The List of Corrections</H4>

This is a list of all known errors and omissions in the
book.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are the first to report an error, you will be
acknowledged in any new edition.

<H4><a name="accompanying">Accompanying Material</a></H4>

Also available for downloading is material to accompany the book.&nbsp;&nbsp;

This includes the ASCII versions of all specifications from the book,
additional modules and configuration files for using the TLC model
checker to check some of the specifications, and a few
exercises.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<!--
I hope that readers will provide additional exercises.&nbsp;&nbsp;

I would also like to include example specifications written by 
others.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Now, the only other example is the 
 <A HREF = "wildfire-challenge.html">Wildfire 
challenge problem</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp;  

The specification of the Alpha memory that it contains will be of
particular interest to readers of the memory specifications in Chapter
11.&nbsp;&nbsp;  

Please contact me if you have any suggestions.

-->
<p>

The material is organized hierarchically, with the material for each
chapter in a separate folder (directory).&nbsp;&nbsp;

Each folder, including the root, has a README file containing the
exercises and an explanation of what else is in the
directory.&nbsp;&nbsp;

The material is available as a Zip file for Windows users and as a
gzipped tar file for Unix users.
