The hyperbook is an unfinished hypertext document that
was meant to be what one would read to learn TLA+ and
PlusCal.&nbsp;  The 
<a href="http://lamport.azurewebsites.net/video/videos.html">
         TLA+ Video Course</a>
now serves as an introduction to TLA+, and I'm recommending

<A href =
   "learning7ca4.html?unhideBut=hide-hillel&amp;unhideDiv=hillel"
  > Hillel Wayne's Web Site and Book </A>
as an introduction to PlusCal.&nbsp;

I have stopped working on the hyperbook and don't know what to
do with it.&nbsp;  (I would welcome suggestions.)

<p>

The first 6 chapters of the hyperbook cover approximately the same
material as the Video Course, but in greater depth and with
different examples.&nbsp;  It also teaches the use of PlusCal.&nbsp;
Chapters 7 through 9 provide more realistic examples.&nbsp;

The hyperbook's <i>TLA+ Proof Track</i> is probably the best
introduction to writing TLA+ proofs and checking them with the TLAPS
prover.

<p>

The rest of this web page describes the state of the hyperbook at
the time of the last release, in 2015.
</DIV>

<H2 id="h2hyper"  class="show-hide"

<DIV id="hyper" class = "hidden-div">

This is the start of a hypertext "book" containing two tutorials:
<i>Principles of Concurrent Computing</i> and <i>Specification of
Concurrent Systems</i>.&nbsp;

The tutorials are two tracks that share much text--especially at the
beginning.&nbsp;

Both tutorials are based
on <a href="tla.html">TLA+</a>.&nbsp;  

The <i>Principles</i> track, which I hope will eventually be suitable
for an undergraduate course on concurrent computing, will mainly use
the 

  <A href =
   "high-level-view13c2.html?unhideBut=hide-pluscal&amp;unhideDiv=pluscal&amp;back-link=hyperbook.html"  > PlusCal algorithm language</A>

rather than
TLA+ for describing algorithms.&nbsp; There is also a <i>TLA+
Proof</i> track that explains how to use <a
href="http://tla.msr-inria.inria.fr/tlaps/content/Home.html">the TLAPS
proof system</a>.

<p>

You will probably read the hyperbook with <A
href="http://get.adobe.com/reader/">Adobe Reader</A>,
but 
 <A href="http://www.foxitsoftware.com/Secure_PDF_Reader/">Foxit Reader</A> 
also works.&nbsp;

Other readers should also work, but it seems that Preview, the default
pdf reader on the Mac, does not.&nbsp;

<p>

I welcome comments and suggestions on the form, style, and
contents.&nbsp;

Also, please tell me if anything doesn't work as you think it should.&nbsp;

My email address is on <a href="http://lamport.org/">my home page</a>.

<p>

The hyperbook consists of a collection of pdf files; the root file is
<code>start.pdf</code> and the remaining files are in the folder
(directory) <code>hyper-tla</code>.&nbsp;  

They are distributed as a zip file that you can <font
size=+1><b>download (save, do not open) by

<A href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/hyperbook.zip">clicking

here</A></b>.&nbsp; 

<b>Extract (unzip) the contents</b></font> into a convenient folder and open (probably by
double-clicking on) the file <code>start.pdf</code>.&nbsp; 

Be sure to follow the directions, which means clicking where it says
 <pre>   If you are just starting to read
   this hyperbook, click here.</pre> 
This leads you to the introduction <i>About This Hyperbook</i>.&nbsp;

Read it.&nbsp; 

You will then know what to do next.

</DIV>

<H2 id="h2news"  class="show-hide" 
    onclick="showHide('hide-news','news')">News
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     <font id="hide-news" >
      [show]</font>
</H2>

<DIV id="news" class = "hidden-div">

I am still rewriting some parts of the hyperbook, so some material may
be in an inconsistent state.&nbsp;   Read the <i>About This Hyperbook</i>
page for more information.&nbsp;   (Click on "If you are just starting..."
from the start page or on the "?" in the left margin from most other
pages.)

<p>

The LaTeX sources for the hyperbook have been released.&nbsp; 
See below.
</DIV>

<H2 id="h2source"  class="show-hide" 
    onclick="showHide('hide-source','source')">The Source Files
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     <font id="hide-source" >
      [show]</font>
</H2>

<DIV id="source" class = "hidden-div">


The LaTeX source files for the hyperbook are now available for 
download.&nbsp;

One reason for this is to encourage you to contribute your own
material to the hyperbook.&nbsp;

(Contact me before starting if you want that material to appear
in the official release of the hyperbook.)&nbsp;

You could also write your own hypertext documents using the 
commands that I created for the purpose.&nbsp;

Reading the source files will allow you to figure out how to do
it.&nbsp;  The file hypertlabook.sty and the packages it imports
define the relevant commands.&nbsp;

<p>

The source files can be downloaded
by
<A href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/hyper-tla-hyperbook.zip">clicking
here</A>.&nbsp;

Extracting the files from thie zip file creates a folder (directory)
 <code>hyper-tla</code>.&nbsp;

To create the pdf files that constitute the hyperbook, open a Unix
shell window from which you can run 
  <code>pdflatex</code>
and connect to the <code>hyper-tla</code> folder.&nbsp;

(To do this in Windows, you can install 
 <a href="https://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a>.)&nbsp;

In that shell, run the command
  <code>sh rundist.sh</code>.

<p>

</DIV>

<H2 id="h2versions"  class="show-hide" 
    onclick="showHide('hide-versions','versions')">Versions
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     <font id="hide-versions" >
      [show]</font>
</H2>

<DIV id="versions" class = "hidden-div">


I hope to post new versions of the hyperbook continually.&nbsp;  

So, far I haven't been very good at doing that, but I hope to do
better.&nbsp; Major changes will be announced on
 <A HREF=
   "https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/tlaplus">the 
      TLA+ Google Group</a>.&nbsp;

However, I may post a new version and change the <i>last modified</i>
date of this page whenever something you should read has changed--even
if it's just the correction of a minor typo.&nbsp;

Downloading and unzipping a file is easy, so check this page
regularly.<!-- /p -->
